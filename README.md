## 将Dynamic Trader 改造成ABP VNext 客户端应用程序

Dynamic data is a portable class library which brings the power of reactive (rx) to collections.  It is open source and the code base lives here [Dynamic Data on GitHub](https://github.com/RolandPheasant/DynamicData). 

To help illustrate how powerful  and easy Dynamic Data is, and to help you get up and running I have created this WPF demo app.  I have made the code behind each screen as simple as possible so it is easy to follow.  

Most of the example screens have been written about on the blog at [dynamic-data.org](http://dynamic-data.org/)

The demo illustrates how the following code:

```csharp
var loader = tradeService.All
    .Connect(trade => trade.Status == TradeStatus.Live) //prefilter live trades only
    .Filter(_filter) // apply user filter
    .Transform(trade => new TradeProxy(trade),new ParallelisationOptions(ParallelType.Ordered,5))
    .Sort(SortExpressionComparer<TradeProxy>.Descending(t => t.Timestamp),SortOptimisations.ComparesImmutableValuesOnly)
    .ObserveOnDispatcher()
    .Bind(_data)   // update observable collection bindings
    .DisposeMany() //since TradeProxy is disposable dispose when no longer required
    .Subscribe();
``` 
 produces this

or how the following extract

 ```csharp  
 var loader = tradeService.Live.Connect()
            .Group(trade => trade.CurrencyPair)
            .Transform(group => new CurrencyPairPosition(group))
            .Sort(SortExpressionComparer<CurrencyPairPosition>.Ascending(t => t.CurrencyPair))
            .ObserveOn(schedulerProvider.MainThread)
            .Bind(_data)
            .DisposeMany()
            .Subscribe();

	//when CurrencyPairPosition class does this
	tradesByCurrencyPair.Cache.Connect()
			.QueryWhenChanged(query =>
			{
				var buy = query.Items.Where(trade => trade.BuyOrSell == BuyOrSell.Buy).Sum(trade=>trade.Amount);
				var sell = query.Items.Where(trade => trade.BuyOrSell == BuyOrSell.Sell).Sum(trade => trade.Amount);
				var count = query.Count;
				return new TradesPosition(buy,sell,count);
			})
			.Subscribe(position => Position = position);
        }
```
Produces this.

This is so easy, a few lines of code which after a short learning curve becomes very easy.

Plus many more dynamic data examples. Additionally there are some examples which show how to integrate with [ReactiveUI](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI). 

The menu looks like this and as you can see there are links to the code behind which hopefully will get you up to speed in no time at all

The examples are being regularly maintained so download again to see more examples.
